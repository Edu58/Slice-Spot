This project is potrays a design for a pizza restaurant website. The website is made in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript and Jquery. It is fully mobile responsive and will look appealing on any device no matter the screen size.

Mobile reponsiveness is the main reason for using Bootstrap 5. jQuery is used to introduce interactivity like hover effects, fading and element toggle effects. It is also used to get form data and reset the form after successful submission.

Javascript is used to create a constructor for the Order object which is used to create an order object with the required properties. A calculatePrice prototype s also added and is used as logic to determine the price of the order.
